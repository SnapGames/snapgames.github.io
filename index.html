			<h1>Platform 2D</h1>
			<p>
				Platform is a 2D Game Engine attempts. based on the fabulous
				tutorials from the ForeignGuyMike from <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ForeignGuyMike/playlists">youtube</a>
			</p>
			<p>The SnapGames Dev Team deal was to create a 2d game platform
				from this work, and provide a fun tooling to develop old school like
				games.</p>
			<p>The first try is for the Artifact ForeignGuyMike demo game.
				Totally rewritten based on the SnapGames Platform 2D engine,
				Artifact is .. the same :) But build with a nice reusable in-house
				game engine.</p>
